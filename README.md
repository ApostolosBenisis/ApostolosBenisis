# About

**I’m an experienced software architect and CTO, equally comfortable building new organisations and products from scratch or enhancing existing ones. I approach challenges with curiosity, resilience, and a practical, fast-paced mindset.**

Over the years I have served in roles such as: CTO, Director of Engineering, Architect, Full-Stack Developer, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Project Manager. I have led teams of up to 30 engineers and delivered outcomes with clarity and shared purpose. I am proud to be both a strategic thinker and a hands-on builder. I enjoy crafting technology visions, growing high-performance teams, developing software, and making things happen.

I have navigated the energy of startups and the rigour of Fortune 500 companies, delivering solutions across diverse domains while staying tech-curious along the way. Even today, I continue to contribute at both levels, hands-on programming and strategic decision-making. Recent highlights include building an open-source conversational chatbot using generative AI that helps young people explore their skills and prepare to enter the labour market.

After more than 20 years in full-time roles, I became a consultant, selecting fast-moving and high-impact projects that require both strategic vision and precise execution. I remain grounded, pragmatic, and results-focused.

I have also founded three ventures (2002, 2011, 2023). My latest, Tabiya, is a non-profit building open-source digital infrastructure such as AI workflows, inclusive taxonomies, and open-tools. It helps governments and NGOs recognise both formal and informal skills, opening up more equitable labour markets.

My professional approach reflects the values of the Agile and Software Craftsmanship manifestos, enriched by Lean and TQM philosophies. I continue to draw inspiration from W. Edwards Deming, Peter Drucker, Robert C. Martin, and Martin Fowler. Their ideas shape my commitment to quality, clarity, and continuous improvement.

When I am not deep in tech, I enjoy reading *HBR*, *Wired*, *Medium*, *HackerNoon*, *Food for Agile Thought*, and *The Exponential View*, or watching YouTube discussions on AI and innovation such as *Discover AI*, *Wes Roth*, and *Curt Jaimungal*. In my free time, you will find me outdoors, staying active through sports and enjoying life with my dog.

**Methods & Practices**

Here are the methodologies and practices in which I am proficient, applied deeply in some areas and in more focused, specialised ways in others:

* LLM-based applications, Agentic Workflows, RAG, embeddings, classification, re-ranking, vector databases, prompt engineering, optimisation, and evaluation of LLM workflows
* Database design and modelling (relational and NoSQL)
* API design and development (RESTful, GraphQL, MCP – Model Context Protocol)
* Scalable, distributed, modular, production-grade systems architecture with security and data protection compliance
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) and DevOps practices
* Test design strategies: Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
* Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban), scaled frameworks (SAFe, LeSS), remote and distributed teams
